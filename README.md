This program plays files from [ASCIImator](http://asciimator.net/).  You'll
need Python 2 and Pygame to use it.  This program is licensed under the MIT
license; see `LICENSE` for details.  The plan is to make an easy way to
download the ASCIImations, but whether that will be handled by a separate
program or not is to be determined.  Meanwhile, the files to be played can be
downloaded from `http://asciimator.net/ascii.files/<number>.js`.  The plan is
also to support ASCIImator Pro files first, then maybe older formats later, as
the parsing is somewhat different for older versions such as ASCIImator 3.
